Converting solar energy into electricity provides a much-needed solution to the energy
crisis the world is facing today. Unfortunately, the theoretical limit of conversion efficiency
of silicon-based solar panels currently in use is 29%. In order to increase this conversion
efficiency, a method of enhancing the amount of light absorption by localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) using metal nanoparticles (NPs) has been considered.
There are two possible effects for improving the efficiency of solar cells by LSPR. One is
to use an electromagnetic field stronger than the incident light generated on the surface of
the metal NPs, and another one is to control the light scattering of the metal NPs. These
effects vary depending on the shape and size of the NPs, but in order to understand and
optimize them, it is essential to simulate the control of the electromagnetic field by metal
NPs.
The purpose of this study is to clarify by simulation, how the amount of light absorption
by localized surface plasmons changes when metal NPs are applied to the surface of an
a-Si (amorphous silicon) solar cell.
We use silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to improve the performance of organic solar cells.
Ag NPs with a radius of about 20 nm or 50 nm were doped into the buffer layer of organic
solar cells. We attribute the efficiency improvement to the size-dependent localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Ag NPs, which can enhance the light harvest ability
of active layer around the Ag NPs. Our results show that solar cells doped with 50 nmradius
Ag NPs exhibit significant improvement of the efficiency, while solar cells doped
with only 20 nm-radius Ag NPs did not give obvious improvement of the performance.
