    "[Meep](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a free and open-source software package for electromagnetic simulations using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. FDTD is a popular method for solving Maxwell's equations, which describe how electromagnetic waves propagate and interact with materials.\n",
